## How to Run
Make sure you are running a version of Python 3. Then run:

By default, the GUI runs using your computer's webcam as video feed. If you would like to run it on a downloaded video file, specify the path to the video file as an additional argument. For example: 

```
python GUI.py test.mp4
```
